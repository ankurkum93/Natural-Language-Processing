We are trying to analyse the sentiment of the review dataset by Amazon which can further be used to analyse the sentiment of any dataset which is labelled as 0 or 1. Our dataset has 2 classes that is 0 or 1 and thats why we have used Binomial classification later on. 
We tried to use 2 algorithms that are KNN and Naive Bayes for the same.
The difference in the accuracy in both training and test for both the techniques is quite prominent.
Also, the results are dependent on the dataset used for training
